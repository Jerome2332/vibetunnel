## ‚úÖ ACCURATE/TRUE Claims

1. **Mac (Native) Notifications** - TRUE
   - NotificationService exists and is fully implemented
   - All notification types work as described
   - Settings UI with toggles is implemented

2. **Web Browser Notifications** - TRUE
   - PushNotificationService is implemented
   - SSE router exists and works
   - Browser permission handling is correct

3. **Claude "Your Turn" Notification** - TRUE
   - Implemented via ActivityDetector callback
   - Events flow through PtyManager ‚Üí SSE ‚Üí Clients
   - Preference toggle exists

4. **Comprehensive Tests** - TRUE
   - 40+ tests across Swift and TypeScript
   - All tests are passing
   - Good coverage of core functionality

5. **Web vs Mac Notification Overlap** - TRUE CONCERN
   - This is a real architectural issue
   - Could result in duplicate notifications
   - Needs a decision on how to handle

## ‚ùå FALSE/MISLEADING Claims

1. **"~4,650 lines added"** - FALSE
   - Actually 35,625 insertions (due to merge)
   - Notification-specific code is ~2,500 lines

2. **"UI Glitches"** - NOT FOUND
   - No evidence in code
   - All UI components appear properly implemented
   - Tests pass for UI functionality

3. **"Code generated slop"** - EXAGGERATED
   - Code quality is actually quite good
   - Tests are comprehensive and well-structured
   - Follows project patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REAL Issues Discovered

1. **Server Not Running During Testing**
   - VibeTunnel server wasn't responding on expected ports
   - This could affect notification delivery
   - May be a configuration or development mode issue

2. **Large Merge Complexity**
   - The merge with amantus/main brought in 520 file changes
   - Makes it harder to review just the notification changes
   - But merge was handled correctly

## üìä Summary

- **Core functionality**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and tested
- **Main concern**: Duplicate notifications across platforms
